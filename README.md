# Solving Period Poverty in BC - Capstone Project

## Overview

This repository is home to the Capstone Project conducted by students from Northeastern University's Masters in Analytics and AI Specialty class of 2024. The project's goal is to apply data science and analytical techniques to tackle period poverty across British Columbia, optimizing the distribution of period products and ensuring effective allocation of resources.

## Project Objective
