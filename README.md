# Solving Period Poverty in BC - Capstone Project

## Overview

This repository is home to the Capstone Project conducted by students from Northeastern University's Masters in Analytics and AI Specialty class of 2024. The project's goal is to apply data science and analytical techniques to tackle period poverty across British Columbia, optimizing the distribution of period products and ensuring effective allocation of resources.

## Project Objective

![Project Objective](./images/project_objective.png)

The objective of this project is to harness the power of data to address the challenges associated with period poverty. Through extensive data analysis, we aim to improve the understanding of needs, streamline distribution efforts, and support the decision-making processes of organizations involved in this cause.

## Sponsors and Contributors

This project is generously sponsored by the United Way of British Columbia (UWBC), Alexa, and Dama. We extend our deepest gratitude to our professor, Dinesh, for his invaluable guidance. This project is a collaborative effort of Northeastern University students: Swathi Raikwar, Shamim Sherafati, and Larissa Anoh.

## Project Structure

- `ETL_Tools/`: Python scripts for the ETL process to prepare the data.
- `Database_Schema/`: SQL scripts for creating a structured database schema.
- `PowerBI_Dashboards/`: Interactive Power BI dashboards for visual analytics.
- `Documentation/`: Detailed guides on utilizing the tools and scripts.
- `ER_Diagrams/`: Visual representations of the database schema.
- `Data/`: Data files for ETL and Power BI analysis.

## Key Components

- **ETL Process**: A set of tools for data preparation and transformation.
- **Database Schema**: SQL database schema with an ER diagram for data organization.

- **Documentation**: In-depth instructions on the ETL process, database schema setup, and dashboard usage.

## Usage

To utilize this project's resources:

1. Run the ETL scripts to process raw data into an analyzable format.
2. Execute SQL scripts to establish the database schema.
3. Use Power BI dashboards to visualize and interpret the data.
4. Consult the documentation for step-by-step guides on each component.
